# Trolls are attacking your comment section!
# A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
# Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
# For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
# Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

def disemvowel(string):
    charList = [char for char in string]
    removedList = []
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    for i in range(len(charList)):
        if charList[i] not in vowels:
            removedList.append(charList[i])
    s = ""
    s = s.join(removedList)
    return s

# Top solution
# def disemvowel(s):
#    return s.translate(None, "aeiouAEIOU")
