# In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year. 
# The population regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 new inhabitants per year come to live in the town.
# How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to p = 1200 inhabitants?

def nb_year(p0, percent, aug, p):
    n = 0;
    while (p0 < p):
        p0 = p0 + p0*percent/100 + aug
        n += 1
    return n
    
# top solution
# def nb_year(population, percent, aug, target):
#    year = 0
#    while population < target:
#        population += population * percent / 100. + aug
#        year += 1
#    return year
