# A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. 
# Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. 
# If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. 
# This is only applicable to the natural numbers.

def digital_root(n):
    while n > 9:
        digitList = [int(char) for char in str(n)]
        n = sum(digitList)
    return n
    
# top solution
# def digital_root(n):
#    return n if n < 10 else digital_root(sum(map(int,str(n))))
