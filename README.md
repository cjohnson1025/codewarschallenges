### Disemvowel Trolls
Trolls are attacking your comment section! A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat. Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed. For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".  
Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

### Digital Root
A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.
