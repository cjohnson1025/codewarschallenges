### Disemvowel Trolls (disemvowel_trolls)
Trolls are attacking your comment section! A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat. Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed. For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".  
Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
### Exes and Ohs (xo)
Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.

### Digital Root (digital_root)
A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.
### Find the Parity Outlier (find_outlier)
You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.
